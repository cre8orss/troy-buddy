# Troy-Buddy

CRE8's group project for Web Systems Development.

Troy Buddy is a web application which serves as an easily accessible tool that highlights Troyâ€™s landmarks. Users can search for local
landmarks and get relevant information about these locations. When users land on our homepage, they can see a carousel which shows
images of locations in Troy. There is also a search bar which will allow users to discover already documented locations or what type 
of locations they want. There is also some text giving some info about Troy as well as weather widget, some trending search, and the
option to add their email to a mailing list. On the suggest page, users are able to drag a marker along our map and pin point any
location they want to add. When they give the name and what type of location it is, the coordinates will automatically be saved and
a new location will be created. Already saved locations are still shown so that users known which locations are already saved. The
explore page has a full screen map that users can look through and find what locations other people have put. The search page is 
where users can search the entire database to find restaurants or locations. The log in and sign up pages allow users to log in 
or sign up through their respective forms.
